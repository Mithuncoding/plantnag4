## üåü The Vision

Imagine PlantCare AI in 2026:

> "A farmer in rural Karnataka opens PlantCare AI on their phone without internet. They take a photo of their crop, get instant AI diagnosis in Kannada with voice output. The app reminds them to water their tomatoes, shows today's mandi prices, and connects them with a local expert for advice. They share their success story on GreenGram, inspiring 1000+ other farmers. They upgrade to premium for advanced features and order fertilizers directly through the app."

**This is achievable with the roadmap above! üöÄ**

## üìû Need Help Prioritizing?

Consider:
1. **User Interviews**: Ask 10 farmers what they need most
2. **Analytics**: See which pages get most traffic
3. **Competitor Analysis**: What are others not doing?
4. **Business Model**: What drives revenue?
